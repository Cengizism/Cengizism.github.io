Collaboratively, I worked on a time management application in BackboneJS and AngularJS for KNRM (Dutch Coastguard), Reddingsbrigade (Dutch BayWatch), and Brandweer (Dutch Fire Department). My primary contribution involved designing and developing the application, enhancing its efficiency for lifesavers to plan their schedules.
