Sweco, an international engineering company renowned for its work in architecture, infrastructure, and GIS software in Europe, embarked on a project to redesign and redevelop one of its core GIS software products, which has been a staple for over 25 years.

At Sweco, I contributed to the redesign and redevelopment of a core GIS software product within a web application built with ReactJS, Twitter Bootstrap, and OpenLayers. I conducted extensive research to define requirements, facilitated sessions to map user journeys, and developed wireframes and interactive prototypes. My role also included frontend development, integrating custom UI widgets and components, and enhancing user interface elements.

**Research & Requirement Definition:**
- Conducted extensive research to define requirements, facilitated sessions for mapping user journeys, and developed wireframes and interactive prototypes.
- Established a complete backlog for the new application based on gathered requirements.

**Persona & User Journey Mapping:**
- Facilitated sessions with the team to define personas, customer journeys, and user flows.
- Designed wireframes and produced prototypes to guide decisions on navigation mapping.

**Wireframing & Prototyping:**
- Created detailed wireframes based on defined user journeys and flows.
- Developed interactive prototypes to validate navigation and application structure.

**Application Development:**
- Developed a ReactJS application utilising Twitter Bootstrap and OpenLayers for GIS-specific implementations.
- Collaborated with the development team to build a single-page application, incorporating numerous custom UI widgets and components.

**UI/UX Design:**
- Designed user interface elements and interactions to enhance user experience.
- Ensured that the new application maintained feature richness while transitioning from desktop to web-based.
