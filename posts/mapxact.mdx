### **Period**  
June 2023 - June 2024

### **Company**  
MapXact (a Volker Vessels Company) - Lieren, Netherlands

### **Role**  
User Experience Designer / Frontend Engineer

### **Summary:**
At MapXact, I played a crucial role as a designer and developer, enhancing the software for visualising subsurface data through advanced ground radar surveys. My work focused on improving the user interface and experience of the frontend application, built with ReactJS, NextJS, ReactFiberJS, ThreeJS, D3, Google Material Design, and MapBox. This application, used on a handheld touch device integrated with ground radar hardware, facilitates human-machine interaction. I managed large amounts of real-time data and redesigned the interface to modernise frameworks and improve usability.

### **Description:**  
MapXact is dedicated to enhancing the safety and efficiency of ground work by visualising subsurface data through advanced ground radar surveys and cutting-edge technologies, including AI.

Hudson is a frontend application designed for human-machine interaction through a handheld touch device, integrated with a ground radar hardware suite. During an active ground scanning session (data acquisition), large amounts of data are produced and displayed in real-time on the frontend application. This visualised data, known as a radargram in industry standards, is saved in the SEGY file format.

### **Tasks & Responsibilities:**
The Hudson release candidate, scheduled for the end of 2023, required several fixes, upgrades, and enhancements requested by operations. Following this, a redesign and refactoring phase was planned to improve user experience, modernise frameworks and libraries, and clean up the codebase.

**UX Audit & User Feedback:**
- Conducted a comprehensive UX audit to identify issues in the current software.
- Interviewed users (operators) and stakeholders to gather feedback and feature requests.

**Backlog Management & Feature Planning:**    
- Assisted management in creating and prioritising backlog items for features and enhancements.
- Ensured iterative development aligned with the product roadmap.

**Workshops & Vision Alignment:**
- Organised workshops to define and align the product vision, user journeys, and roadmap.
- Facilitated sessions to refine new features and ensure alignment with user needs.

**Implementation & Testing:**
- Implemented improvements and enhancements in the Hudson software made with ReactJS, NextJS, ReactFiberJS, ThreeJS, D3, Google Material Design and MapBox, focusing on ground radar functionality and advanced mapping.
- Conducted field user tests with operators to validate design and functionality.

**Redesign & Refactoring:**
- Led the redesign and refactoring of Hudson, adopting Google Material Design for the new UI.
- Utilised the "design tokens" methodology for consistent UI and codebase integration.

**Completion & Handover:**
- Successfully rebuilt the frontend application with the new user interface.
- Completed the consulting task with the final delivery of the updated Hudson software.
