VolkerRail, a key partner of ProRail, is responsible for maintaining railways in the Netherlands. The railway system consists of numerous electronic and mechanical components, each with its own life cycle. VolkerRail launched a pilot project to automate decision-making processes by collecting big data from special sensor-equipped trains and combining it with existing equipment information. This project aims to provide advisory planning and options based on lifetime and budget considerations.

I designed and contributed to a prototype application in AngularJS and NodeJS for VolkerRail, which was subsequently taken into continuous software development. This application is currently used by ProRail and many other European rail companies. This project involved the significant challenge of translating complex outputs from multiple systems into a single application, maximising efficiency by effectively displaying big data.
